# Power-BI-Project
This is my First project on Power BI Data Visualization tool.This project entails implementing an end-to-end replica of Flipkart data analysis dashboard. For this Power Bi project idea, use the Sample_superstore  data from Kaggle site. After extracting the data from site .First use  Get data submenu and extract data in Excel form and transform in to powe query editor .And performing the data cleaning task  after that load the data . Once finish the ETL process, you can move on to data modeling ,data visualize our data using Power Bi reports. For creating the dashboard, you will use pie charts, bar graphs, clustered bar chart, stacked bar chart,card,slicer,tree maps, doughnut Charts, etc.
